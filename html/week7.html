    <h1 class="post_title">React</h1>
    <p class="post_subtitle">Week 7, 11/04/2021</p>
    <p>This week we started using React JS. The component system is really useful and makes things more dynamic. Also,
        the code duplication that was sometimes nessecary in static HTML / CSS is no longer needed with React.</p>
    <p>Components are powerful, and are made even more so by the parameters they can be passed called props.
        Unfortunatley, React does not have built in type safety (that I know of), so I decided to look up an
        alternative. What I found is called PropTypes, and is imported like so:</p>
    <blockquote>import PropTypes from 'prop-types';</blockquote>
    <p>You can replace this example React component with one of your own:</p>
    <blockquote>
        class Example extends React.Component {<br>
        &emsp; render() {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp; return (<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &lt;h1&gt;My name is {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp; );<br>
        &emsp; }<br>
        }
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now, add this to the bottom of the class:</p>
    <blockquote>
        Example.propTypes = {<br>
        &emsp; name: PropTypes.string<br>
        };
    </blockquote>
    <p>String is far from the only type that prop types will recognize. Array, func, bool, number, object, symbol, node,
        element, elementType, and instance are all supported. Another cool thing you could do is have default values for
        props in case nothing is passed when the component is created:</p>
    <blockquote>
        Example.defaultProps = {<br>
            &emsp;  name: 'Default name!'<br>
          };
    </blockquote>
