    <h1 class="post_title">CSS Animations</h1>
    <p class="post_subtitle">Week 2, 9/9/2021</p>
    <p>This week we began using CSS in class, though I had used it previously. I decided to use CSS as the basis for
        this week's blog post as I wanted to learn more about animations and backgrounds. Before I felt like I had only
        barely touched the surface of what could be done with CSS, and after doing some reaseach I still feel that way.
        I decided to change out the boring one color background and replace it with an animated gradient.
    </p>
    <p>Inside the body of my stylesheet I put the following.</p>
    <blockquote>background: linear-gradient(-45deg, #ee7752, #e73c7e, #23a6d5, #23d5ab);</blockquote>
    <p>This creates the gradient and tilts it at a 45 degree angle. The hex values are just the colors of the gradient.
    </p>
    <blockquote>background-size: 400% 400%;<br>
        animation: gradient 25s ease infinite;
    </blockquote>
    <p>These lines make the gradient much bigger than the actual page and trigger the animation below. The animation is
        set to loop, and I picked 25 seconds as a nice and slow timeframe.</p>
    <blockquote>0% {<br>
            &emsp; background-position: 0% 50%;<br>
        }<br>
        50% {<br>
            &emsp; background-position: 100% 50%;<br>
        }<br>
        100% {<br>
            &emsp; background-position: 0% 50%;<br>
        }
    </blockquote>
