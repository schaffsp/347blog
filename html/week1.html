    <h1 class="post_title">Getting Started</h1>
    <p class="post_subtitle">Week 1, 8/31/2021</p>
    <p>This week was the start of our static HTML unit in class and is also the start of our regular blogs on web
        development. Writing straight HTML has a certain nostalgia for me as it was likely the first code I ever wrote
        in Elementary School. Despite having written a good amount of it in the past this week was helpful as a
        refresher, and I didn't even know about the blockquote tag.</p>
    <blockquote>It looks like this and allows for easier indenting. I'm sure it will come in handy in the future because
        the less floating I have to do the better.</blockquote>
    <p>I'm most excited to learn React formally as this summer I spent some time learning it through websites and
        Youtube tutorials. I found myself habitually thinking about how to do this project in React, and was considering
        using props as the body and title of the post to reduce code duplication.</p>
    <p>I'm not really sure how long these need to be or what I have to write about but I hope this is okay.</p>
