    <h1 class="post_title">Strange HTML Tags</h1>
    <p class="post_subtitle">Week 4, 9/23/2021</p>
    <p>This week I decided to venture away from CSS and look into some more obscure HTML tags that I might be able to
        use in future projects. The first one, acronym is demonstrated below:</p>
    <p>Hover over <acronym title="More information pops up!">this</acronym>.</p>
    <p>Another useful tag that has a similar purpose is the details tag. It also displays extra information but is
        instead activated by a mouse click.</p>
    <details>
        <summary>Click this line of text.</summary>
        Here is some more information!
    </details>
    <p>By the way, I have not added any additional styling to the details tag. It looks like that by default, I think
        it's pretty cool.</p>
    <p>As I write this, it is <time>8:11</time>.</p>
    <p>The last tag I found interesting enough to write about is the iframe tag. It allows you to embed another webpage
        within the current one. It also has options for sizing to make sure things don't get too out of control. I have
        embedded the twodee website below:</p>
