    <p>I liked the projects in this class, and the online notes were very helpful as refrence when working on the
        projects and labs. The only thing that I would change would be instead of maintaining a weekly blog post, each
        week a more robust lab centering around a specific topic could be due. The lab could be started in class --
        similar to how we worked on labs this semester, and I think that more time to work on each lab would allow for
        more interesting topics. Come friday, a submission could be due and graded.</p>
    <p>I really enjoyed this class and would reccommend it to other students!</p>
