    <h1 class="post_title">CSS Animations Continued</h1>
    <p class="post_subtitle">Week 3, 9/16/2021</p>
    <p>This week I decided to continue with CSS animations. We learned flexboxes this week, but I felt as though I could
        not do anything more interesting with them than what we did in class so I continued with my efforts from last
        week.</p>
    <p>While the gradient background was cool last week, I felt as if it had readability issues and may be espicially
        bad for those with accesibiliy concerns which is why I am removing it from subsequent blog posts.</p>
    <p>I like the idea of having some sort of animation for when the page loads, while the one I added to this page is
        really simple I feel as if it demonstrates the concept.</p>
    <blockquote>animation: fadeInAnimation ease 2s;<br>
        animation-iteration-count: 1;<br>
        animation-fill-mode: forwards;</blockquote>
    <p>I added the above lines to the body tag of my css file. I thought I was going to have to play with the '::before'
        attribute but it was really just a simple animation played once. The animation looks like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
        @keyframes fadeInAnimation {<br>
        &emsp;0% {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;opacity: 0;<br>
        &emsp;}<br>
        &emsp;100% {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp; opacity: 1;<br>
        &emsp;}<br>
        }
    </blockquote>
