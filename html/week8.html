    <p>In larger react projects with many components, the repetitive typing can get pretty annoying. I found a visual
        studio code plugin that improves my React quality of life by adding keyboard shortcuts to automaticially create
        component templates. An example would be creating a new file called Example.js and typing the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>rafce</blockquote>
    <p>Once the enter key is pressed, the contents of the file are replaced with the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
        import React from 'react'<br>
        <br>
        const Example = () => {<br>
        &emsp; return (<br>
        &emsp;&emsp; &lt;div&gt;<br>
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br>
        &emsp;)<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        export default Example

    </blockquote>
    <p>I really like this extension and have used it for many of my own personal project. I like it because it just
        takes a lot of the setup out of the programmer's hands and allows them to focus on the actual content of the app
        they're building.</p>
    <p>rafce is not the only shortcut included in this extension, there are dozens, although rafce is the one I use by
        far the most often. Instructions for how to download and install the plugin, as well as a list of its shortcuts
        and how to use it are all at the following link:</p>
