    <h1 class="post_title">React Styled Components</h1>
    <p class="post_subtitle">Week 9, 12/02/2021</p>
    <p>This week I decided to look into styled-components for react. It is a library for react that integrates CSS into
        .JS files. It has some behind the scenes optimizations from what I
        read, but I like it because of the simplicity it provides in not having to link CSS files all the time. It is
        also a fairly popular library.</p>
    <p>To install it, type the following into a terminal opened to your project directory:</p>
    <blockquote>npm install styled-components</blockquote>
    <p>Then, in any .js file you use styled components in, simply import it like so:</p>
    <blockquote>import styled from 'styled-components';</blockquote>
    <p>Here is an example in code:</p>
    <blockquote>
        const customH1 = styled.h1`<br>
        &emsp;color: blue;<br>
        `
    </blockquote>
    <p>The custome styled components are declared like any other variable, and are flexible in that any valid CSS code
        writen between the ` symbols will be applied to the object. The h1, in "styled.h1", is simply an HTML tag. It
        can be replaced with div, p, h2, and etc.</p>
    <p>Now, somewhere lower in the file, you can type the following to use your custom styled-component.</p>
    <blockquote>
        &lt;customH1&gt;*SOME TEXT*&lt;/customH1&gt;
    </blockquote>
    <p>My favorite feature of styled components is that it allows for JS to be inserted into CSS, and not just the other
        way around. Here is an example:</p>
    <blockquote>
        const customH1 = styled.h1`<br>
        &emsp;color: ${props.color};<br>
        `
    </blockquote>
