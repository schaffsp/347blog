    <p>This week with midterm exams I decided to do something interesting that wouldn't nessecarily challege my
        programing skills. I wanted to embedd audio into future projects, and after looking at the different ways to
        play audio I decided on the following as not only the best but also one of the easiest.</p>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="Joe_Biden_Wake_Up.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element
    </audio>
    <p>Hopefully, the above allows you to play, pause, adjust volume, and adjust playback speed of a concerned citizen
        addressing President Joeseph R. Biden. If you see the message
        "Your browser does no support the audio element", I tried Chrome and Firefox with no issue.</p>
    <blockquote>&lt;audio controls&gt;</blockquote>
    <p>This acts as a container for whatever audio you intend to play. You can put multiple different files of different
        types, such ass ogg, mp3, and etc. Right now I only have one: </p>
    <blockquote>&emsp;&lt;source src="Joe_Biden_Wake_Up.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;</blockquote>
    <p>Now all thats left to do is close it like so.</p>
    <blockquote>&lt;/audio&gt;</blockquote>
